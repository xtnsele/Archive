**Resetting Snom M3**

Have you tried resetting the base station the M3 is connected to? You can do this by holding down the 'reset' button on the back of the base station for 10-15 seconds or until all 4 amber lights on the front light up all at once. Then try re-registering the handsets and updating the fw 2.02 handset.
